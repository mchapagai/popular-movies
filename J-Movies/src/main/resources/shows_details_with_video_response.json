Perhaps it's because we're talking about the creator of Family Guy, American Dad and A Million Ways to Die in the West. Maybe that set my funny bone's expectations too high but the guy is indeed hilarious and I suppose that was the standard I was hoping for.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this comes off more as pure homage to Star Trek with a little sprinkling of humour here and there. I gave it a chance with three episodes. I'll give it another chance with the fourth episode but if that doesn't tickle me pink, well, this series will be off my list.",
